# FDSOI-project
Design of a FD-SOI nMOS transistor (60 nm node) with TCAD Sentaurus.
1. Pen & paper design of the device;
2. Fabrication process with the SPROCESS tool;
3. Electrical simulation with the SDEVICE tool to verify the correct behavior of the transistor
and evaluate the main figures of merit;
4. Implementation of advanced technological processes, e.g., RMG and high-Îº gate dielectric.
The project was implemented in a group of four people under the supervision of Prof. Gianluca Piccinini (PoliTo, DET).
